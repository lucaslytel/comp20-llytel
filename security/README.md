Readme for Assignment 4

This assignment was mostly correctly implemented. I based most of my attempts off what we have done in class surrounding security vulnerabilities. I worked with David Ngetich to understand what potential problems we have in our code. I also used POSTMAN to keep track of the various outputs. I spend appox. 2 hours on this assignment.
