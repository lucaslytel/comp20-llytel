Thursday Feb 28th

I began assignment 2. I feel quite overwhelmed by the assignment so I decided to focus on implementing one part. I basically copied the example from https://github.com/tuftsdev/WebProgramming/blob/gh-pages/examples/google_maps/geolocation_map.html in order to try and get my location to be the first thing correctly done. The next time I work on assignment 2 I will try and implement the part about reading in the JSON data. I am worried because I have not tested whether what I just coded actually does what I want it to.
