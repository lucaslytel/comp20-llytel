I began assignment 2. I feel quite overwhelmed by the assignment so I decided to focus on implementing one part. I basically copied the example from https://github.com/tuftsdev/WebProgramming/blob/gh-pages/examples/google_maps/geolocation_map.html in order to try and get my location to be the first thing correctly done. The next time I work on assignment 2 I will try and implement the part about reading in the JSON data. I am worried because I have not tested whether what I just coded actually does what I want it to.

I continued working on the implementation of posting a username a lat and lng in order to recieve and subsequently parse the JSON data. I have not finished implementing the get_user fuction and am unsure about how to actually test this. I am going to go to TA office hours and work on this tomorrow. I find it difficult to focus on one thing with this assignment because I have not really built something like this before. I do not think that my map is rendering which means there is something wrong with my render function.

Monday/Tuesday 

I continued working on the display and location functions. Cannot figure out why my passengers if statement does not work. Will go to the TA's and probably use a couple of tokens. I understand the use of functions but seem to be stuck and can't figure out why.
