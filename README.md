README - Final for Comp20

1. The purpose of this git repo is for me to have a catalogue of my work so that I can go back to it and potentialy show it to employers. 
2. My favorite lab was the simpsons lyrics one. 
3. I think I have grown in my ability to get outside of my comfort zone while maintaining the skills that i've gained in the other disciplines that I studied. Programming is not my strong suit and to be honest I did not always give 100% of my effort for this class because I was more focused on my job or social relationships. However, I think this course gave me a great starting place for continued learning later in life.
4. The most important thing I learned in this course was how to search for answers. Ex 1. When I didn't know the basic syntax for string concatenation and I was able to use stack overflow to figure it out. Ex 2. Asking for help. I have a lot of friends who are very skilled in computer science and was able to ask them for help in ways that was meaningful for both parties. 
5. I really want to delve deeper into Javascript because I can see that i've barely scrathced the surface of it's potential. I might want to redo assignment 1 for fun in the future.
