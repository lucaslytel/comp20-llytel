Lab 4 README

2/19/19 - I spent one hour working on Lab 4 - reading the references and cataloguing the video times. Worked with a TA to get the basics of getElementById and how that interacts with the document object model. 

2/21/19 - I spent a remaining hour finishing the work that I had began the other day. I made the style.css file and played around with some funny memes. I was wondering if it is possible to have the lyrics update in a more specific way that would be easier for many of them?
